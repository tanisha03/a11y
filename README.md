# a11y

Accessibility or a11y is Web Inclusion, it is the practice to develop the websites for everyone irrespective of any disability or impairment. In the metrics used to define the performance of the website, accessibility is often an ignored feature. However, such a practice does a lot of damage to the businesses out there  because it makes the website unusable for a specific section of users. Thus before your think of writing a cleaner and modular code, do think of writing an "accessible" code.

This repo contains all the codes I have worked on for accessible UI components in pure HTML,CSS and Javascript. Inspired from the same I started with a [blog](https://a11y-friendly.netlify.com/) to advocate a11y. You can find the repo of the blog [here](https://github.com/tanisha03/a11y-friendly) .
